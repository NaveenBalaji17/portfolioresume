# Student Portfolio — scaffold

This is a minimal, professional student portfolio scaffold. Files added:

- `index.html` — main site
- `styles.css` — styling
- `script.js` — small interactivity (nav toggle, contact mailto)

Quick preview (choose one):

1) Python (works if you have Python installed):

```bash
cd "e:/PORTFOLIO"
python -m http.server 8000
# then open ://localhttphost:8000 in your browser
```

2) Node (serve):

```bash
cd "e:/PORTFOLIO"
npx serve -s .
```

Next steps:
- Replace placeholder text and add project links.
- Add a `resume.pdf` file to the folder for the Resume button to download.
- Deploy to GitHub Pages, Netlify, or Vercel when ready.
